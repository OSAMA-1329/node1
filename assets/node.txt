A node can also refer to a basic unit of a data structure, such as a linked list or tree data structure. 

Nodes contain data and may also link to other nodes.
Links between nodes are often implemented by pointers. 

Node may also refer to Node.js, an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment and library for running web applications outside the client's browser. 
Node.js allows developers to write JavaScript code that runs directly in a computer process instead of in a browser.
 It can be used to write server-side applications with access to the operating system, file system, and everything else required to build fully-functional applications.
